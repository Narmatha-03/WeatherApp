Weatherpile

Review :

Weatherpile is a straightforward web application which gives weather information depending on user input. It is equipped with a search box for inserting the location and shows the temperature, humidity and wind speed among others as current weather conditions. For locations that do not exist, there is an error message.

Inclusions :

Find weather by place.

Indicate temperature, description of the weather, humidity and wind speed.

Invalid locations have an error handler mechanism.

To enhance user experience better responsive design.

Files :

index.html: This is the main HTML file that acts as a skeleton for the Weather Application.

style.css: The CSS file changes how the app looks.

script.js: This JavaScript file makes it possible to search dynamically through content and update it.

CSS: Styles the application to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles the functionality for searching weather data and updating the UI with the fetched information.
